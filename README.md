# Shopkeeper_ATM_System
 A Unity project implementing a shop management system where players can interact with shopkeepers, manage their inventory, and perform transactions. The system includes features such as buying and selling items, interacting with an ATM for coin transactions, and a bed for simulated sleep interactions that affect the player's bank account balance.
